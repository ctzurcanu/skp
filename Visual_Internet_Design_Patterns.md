Visual Internet Design Patterns
===============================


* VI (Visual Internet) definition and characteristics
	* deep immersion
		* viewer is used full-screen
		* reduced need for keyboard as input
		* navigation from one provider to the next is seamless (no need to know the URL)
		* common theming for multiple providers
	* predilection for vectorial space data
* VI and the Semantic Web
	* VI as consumer of SW data
* VI in 2D
	* recommended use cases: text, formated text, terrestrial/surface maps, microscopy, 2D graphs, diagrams, shapes, icons, ideograms, photography, video, atlas plates, tomography/radiology, electronic circuits, floor plans, DNA maps, simple charts
	* software design
	* ui patterns
	* viewer control
* VI in 3D
	* recommended use cases: anatomical structures, astronomy, 3D models, CAD, architecture, mechanical structures, brain maps, gene activation space, topographic maps, deep marine/underground maps
	* software design
	* ui patterns
	* viewer control
* Data Entry:
	* keyboard, parametrized keyboard
	* mouse
	* touch devices
	* gyroscope
	* head position (AR and VR)
* Interconnection and API for automatic consumption
	* Absolute and relative units
	* Controlled vocabulary interchange
	* Theme interchange
	* Language interchange
	* Embedding rules: partial hashing of URLs
	* Data distribution on update, insert, delete
* Formatting for printing and exact resolution ratios
	* Printing to paper ratio
* Metainterface and navigation control
	* by semantics
	* ontology
	* tag intersection
	* by dimensional neighborhood
		* discrete
		* continuous
* List of present providers and points of entry
